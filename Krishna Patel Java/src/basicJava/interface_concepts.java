//	Interface will have only unimplemented methods
//	Interface can have implemented methods, if we dclare the method as static/default
//	We cannot create object for an interface
//	interface should always and always contain unimplemented methods
//	we need to use implements keyword to extend a interface in a child class
	
//	It is possible to create an object of an interface by referencing to the implemented class

// 100% abstarction aim
// we can achieve 100% abstraction by using Interface.
// And if we use abstact class we can achieve 0 - 100 % abstraction
